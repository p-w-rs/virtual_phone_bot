# Virtual Phone Answer

This repo is a work in progress, the original story is that one day I was fed up with telemarketers so I wanted to create a bot that would answer my phone and waste thier time pretending to want to buy thier product.

I wanted it to be, good so I decided to use chat gpt to determine what to say and wanted to use vall-e to make it sound like it was really me.

This project has since morphed into an idea to have a bot that answers your phone and talks to the person to determine whetehr to put the call through or just take a message based on the user preferences given as a system prompt to chat gpt.
